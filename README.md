# Political Leaning Detection in News Headlines
This project aims to analyze political bias in mainstream media by classifying news articles from various outlets as right-leaning, centrist, or left-leaning. The goal is to assess potential biases within these news sources and provide insights into their political orientations. The implementation leverages transformers for sequence classification, alongside tools for preprocessing, training, and evaluating machine learning models.

## Possible Use Cases
